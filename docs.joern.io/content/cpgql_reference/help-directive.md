title: Help Directive
---

The Help Directive is a CPGQL Directive which returns textual descriptions of other directives.

If it is executed by itself, it shows an overview of Top-Level Commands:

```java
joern> help 
res0: Helper = Welcome to the interactive help system. Below you find a table of all available
top-level commands. To get more detailed help on a specific command, just type

`help.<command>`.

Try `help.importCode` to begin with.

```


If executed with a _Top-Level Command_ _CPGQL Component_ prefix, it describe that _Top-Level Command_:

```java
joern> help.save 
res0: String = """
Close and reopen all loaded CPGs. This ensures that changes have been flushed to
disk.

Returns list of affected projects"""
```

If executed as part of a traversal, it prints available steps and their description at this point. Note that this list may not be complete - use `<tab>` completion for the full list.
