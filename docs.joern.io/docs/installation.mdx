## Prerequisites

* JDK 11 (get here for example: https://openjdk.java.net/install/); newer JDK versions _might_ work, but have not been properly tested

## Installing Pre-Built Binaries

Pre-built binaries of the joern-cli are available at:

https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/joern/releases/

To install the latest release, simply execute the following

```bash
mkdir joern && cd joern # optional
curl -L "https://github.com/joernio/joern/releases/latest/download/joern-install.sh" -o joern-install.sh
chmod u+x joern-install.sh
./joern-install.sh --interactive
```

and follow the installer instructions.
By default, joern will be installed at `~/bin/joern`.

You can test your installation as follows:

```bash
cd <path_to_joern>/joern/joern-cli
./joern
Compiling (synthetic)/ammonite/predef/interpBridge.sc
Compiling (synthetic)/ammonite/predef/replBridge.sc
Compiling (synthetic)/ammonite/predef/DefaultPredef.sc
Compiling /home/tmp/shiftleft/joern/(console)

## Building from Source Code

To build joern-cli from source code, you need to
install the Scala build tool (sbt), which you can install by following
the instructions at https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html. Any 1.x
version of sbt works as sbt downloads the correct version for building
joern as part of the build process.

If you are building Joern using macOS you will need to install the
greadlink package:

```bash
brew install coreutils
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joernio/joern.git
cd joern
sbt stage
```

This builds joern-cli in the current directory. To
build the  distribution zip file (`joern-cli.zip`), run `sbt createDistribution`.

## Configuring the JVM for Optimal Performance

Code analysis can require lots of memory, and unfortunately, the JVM does not pick up the available amount of memory by itself. While tuning Java memory usage is a discipline in its own right, it is usually sufficient to specify the maximum available amount of heap memory using the JVM's -Xmx flag. The easiest way to achieve this globally is by setting the environment variable JAVA_OPTS as follows:

```bash
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx${N}G"
```

where $N is the amount of memory in gigabytes. For example, to allow the JVM to use 20 gigabytes of RAM, you would issue the following:

```bash
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx20G"
```

You can add this line to your shell startup script, e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc.
