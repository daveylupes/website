The interpreter can also be accessed via an HTTP API. Its primary jobs
are to (a) provide an interface to allow querying Code Property Graphs
from non-JVM-based programming languages, and (b) enabling clients
with limited computational resources to outsource CPG construction and
querying to a server machine.

The server can be spawned as follows:

```shell
joern --server
```

Or, with HTTP endpoints protected by basic authentication:

```shell
joern --server --server-auth-username username --server-auth-password password
```

The hostname and port can also be specified:

```shell
joern --server --server-host localhost --server-port 8081
```

A sample client is available for Python at:

## For Developers

If you are interested in querying Code Property Graphs from your
favorite programming language and that language is not JVM-based and
not Python, then the following information on the server's API may be
of interest to you.

The HTTP API allows posting queries and obtaining
responses. Additionally, a Websocket is offered that clients can
subscribe to in order to be notified by the server when query
responses are available.


This will spawn a web server on port 8080 with the following
functionality: 


| Route  | Description  | Method | POST Body         | Response Body     |
| ------ | ------------ | ------ | ------------      | -------------     |
| /query | Submit query | POST   | {"query": $query} | {"uuid": "$uuid"} |
| /result/$uuid | Retrieve response | GET    |  -     | {"success": "{true, false}", "stdout": "$stdout", "stderr" : "$stderr"} |


where `$query` is the query to be executed, `$uuid` is an id assigned
to the query by the server upon receipt, and `$stdout` and `$stderr`
is the data written by the interpreter to standard output and standard
error respectively in response to the query.

If a response for a query is not yet available, the response body is
of the form `{"success" : "false", ...} ` and the client is expected
to ask for the response at a later point in time. For interactive use
cases, this polling approach may be problematic. In this case, the
client can subscribe to a Websocket offered via

```shell
ws://$hostname:8080/connect
```

where `$hostname` is the name of the host on which the server is
running. Once subscribed, uuids of completed queries are reported on
the web socket.

Note that the server exclusively implements remote access to an
interpreter, it does not implement sandboxing. As such, it is not
to be considered a security boundary and sandboxing must be achieved
via other means in production environments.
